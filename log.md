# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9th, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Back to coding. Going through a tutorial about OOP PHP and MVC in Udemy. 

**Thoughts:** Pretty good first day, concepts and examples were easier to understand than I expected. I Hope this continues to be this way. After all, it's just day 1.
